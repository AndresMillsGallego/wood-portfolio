    "This page exists to showcase a love and appreciation for art, creativity, and the unmatched satisfaction that comes from seeing something created from nothing. I have always loved to learn and to work with my hands, whether it's playing music, working with wood, or building something new with code. These pages contain a collection of some of my favorite projects that I have worked on over the years, including one of my most recent projects...this very web application.",
